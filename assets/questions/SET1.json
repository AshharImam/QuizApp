    "explanation": " answer B. Time and materials (T&M) contracts are a cross between fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts. The full amount of the material costs is not known at the time the contract is awarded. This resembles a cost-reimbursable contract because the costs will continue to grow during the contract’s life and are reimbursable to the contractor. The buyer bears the biggest risk in this type of contract. • T&M contracts can resemble fixed-price contracts when unit rates are used, for example. Unit rates might be used to preset the rates of certain elements or portions of the project. For example, a contracting agency might charge you $150 per hour for a .NET programmer, or a leasing company might charge you $2,000 per month for the hardware you’re leasing during the testing phase of your project. These rates are preset and agreed upon by the buyer and seller ahead of time. • T&M contracts are most often used when you need human resources with specific skills and when you can quickly and precisely define the scope of work needed for the project.

Once the facts are uncovered, they're presented to the parties and the decision will be clear. Thus, the solution becomes a permanent one and the conflict expires. This is a win-win solution. Multiple viewpoints are discussed and shared using this technique, and team members have the opportunity to examine all the perspectives of the issue.

    "explanation": " answer A. Parametric estimating is a quantitatively based estimating method that multiplies the quantity of work by the rate or uses an algorithm in conjunction with historical data to determine cost, budget, or duration estimates. The best way to describe it is with an example. Suppose you are working on a companywide network upgrade project. This requires you to run new cable to the switches on every floor in the building. To come up with an estimate, you can use parametric estimates to determine activity duration estimates by taking a known element—in this case, the amount of cable needed—and multiplying it by the amount of time it takes to install a unit of cable. In other words, suppose you have 10,000 meters of new cable to run. You know from past experience it takes 1 hour to install 100 meters. Using this measurement, you can determine an estimate for this activity of 100 hours to run the new cable. Therefore, the cable activity duration estimate is 100 hours.

    "a": "Transfer                ",
    "b": "Acceptance ",
    "c": "Mitigate",
    "d": "Avoid",
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "answer: C. Mitigation attempts to reduce the impact of a risk event should it occurs. Making plans to arrange for the leased equipment reduces the consequences of the risk. When you mitigate a risk, you attempt to reduce the probability of a risk event occurring or reduce its impacts to an acceptable level. This strategy is a lot like defensive driving. You see an obstacle in the road ahead, survey your options, and take the necessary steps to avoid the obstacle and proceed safely on your journey. Seeing the obstacle ahead (identifying risk) allows you to reduce the threat by planning ways around it or planning ways to reduce its impact if the risk does occur (mitigation strategies). According to the PMBOK® Guide, the purpose of mitigation is to reduce the probability that a risk will occur and/or reduce the impact of the risk to a level where you can accept the risk and its outcomes. It's easier to take actions early on that will reduce the probability of a risk event or its consequences than it is to fix the damage once it has occurred. Some examples of risk mitigation include performing more tests, using less complicated processes, creating prototypes, and choosing more reliable vendors. For The Exam, 1. Strategies for Negative Risks or Threats  Avoid: It usually involves changing the project management plan to eliminate the threat entirely.  Examples: extending the schedule, changing the Strategy, or reducing scope.  Transfer: is a risk response strategy whereby the project team shifts the impact of a threat to a third party, transferring the risk simply gives another party responsibility for its management—it does not eliminate it .  Examples: Buy insurance, performance bonds, warranties guarantees, a fixed-price contract may transfer risk to the seller. Use of a cost-plus contract may transfer the cost risk to the buyer.  Mitigate: is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the probability of occurrence or impact of a risk.  Examples: prototypes, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component.  Accept: This strategy indicates that the project team has decided not to change the project management plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify any other suitable response strategy.(strategy for both threats and Opportunities)  Examples: active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the risks. 2. Strategies for Positive Risks or Opportunities  Exploit: The exploit strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes to ensure that the opportunity is realized.  Examples: assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration required to realize project objectives.  Enhance: The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or the positive impacts of an opportunity. Identifying and maximizing key drivers of these positive-impact risks may increase the probability of their occurrence.  Examples: enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to finish early.  Share: Sharing a positive risk involves allocating some or all of the ownership of the opportunity to a third party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project.  Examples: joint ventures.  Accept: See previous strategies.

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "answer B. The following are six methods of conflict management: Direct/Forcing: One person forces a solution on the other parties. This is an example of a win-lose conflict resolution technique. • Smoothing/Accommodating: Smoothing/accommodating is a temporary way to resolve conflict where the areas of agreement are emphasized over the areas of difference so the real issue stays buried. This is an example of a lose-lose conflict resolution technique because neither side wins. • Compromise: Compromise is achieved when each of the parties involved in the conflict gives up something to reach a solution. This is an example of a no-win conflict resolution technique, because neither side gets what they wanted. • Confrontation/Problem Solving: Confrontation and problem solving are the best ways to resolve conflict. One of the key actions performed with this technique is a fact-finding mission. This is the conflict resolution approach project managers use most often and is an example of a win-win conflict resolution technique. • Collaborating: when multiple viewpoints are discussed and shared and team members have the opportunity to examine all the perspectives of the issue, collaboration occurs. Collaborating will lead to true consensus where team members commit to the decision. • Withdrawal/Avoidance: One of the parties gets up, leaves, and refuses to discuss the conflict. This is an example of a lose-lose conflict resolution technique. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 349]"

    "d": "Avoidance",
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "answer: C. Mitigation attempts to reduce the impact of a risk event should it occurs. Making plans to arrange for the rented generator reduces the consequences of the risk. When you mitigate a risk, you attempt to reduce the probability of a risk event occurring or reduce its impacts to an acceptable level. This strategy is a lot like defensive driving. You see an obstacle along the road ahead, survey your options, and take the necessary steps to avoid the obstacle and proceed safely on your journey. Seeing the obstacle ahead (identifying risk) allows you to reduce the threat by planning ways around it or planning ways to reduce its impact if the risk does occur (mitigation strategies). According to the PMBOK® Guide, the purpose of mitigation is to reduce the probability that a risk will occur and/or reduce the impact of the risk to a level where you can accept the risk and its outcomes. It's easier to take actions early on that will reduce the probability of a risk event or its consequences than it is to fix the damage once it has occurred. Some examples of risk mitigation include performing more tests, using less complicated processes, creating prototypes, and choosing more reliable vendors. [PMBOK Sixth edition, Page 443]"

Teams are typically not bound by timeboxes and will work on the highest priority item in the backlog of work. • Focus on continuous delivery. Teams are focused on flowing work through the system to completion and not beginning new work until work in progress is completed. • Increased productivity and quality. Productivity and quality are increased by limiting work in progress. • Increased efficiency. Checking each task for value adding or non-value-added activities and removing the non-value adding activities. • Team member focus. Limited work in progress allows the team to focus on the current work. • Variability in the workload. When there is unpredictability in the way that work arrives, and it becomes impossible for teams to make predictable commitments; even for short periods of time. • Reduction of waste. Transparency makes waste visible so it can be removed. Option (A) Crystal methodologies are designed to scale, and provide a selection of methodology rigor based on project size (number of people involved in the project) and the criticality of the project. Crystal Methodology realizes that each project may require a slightly tailored set of policies, practices, and processes in order to meet the project’s unique characteristics. The family of methodologies use different colors based on “weight” to determine which methodology to use. The use of the word crystal comes from the gemstone where the various “faces” represent underlying core principles and values. Option (C) Scrumban is an agile approach originally designed as a way to transition from Scrum to Kanban. As additional agile frameworks and methodologies emerged, it became an evolving hybrid framework in and of itself where teams use Scrum as a framework and Kanban for process improvement.

Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as duration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future project.  When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basis for estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known differences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when there is a limited amount of detailed information about the project.  Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques, but it is also less accurate.
