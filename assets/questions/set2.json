    "c": "Remove some other feature and add the new feature",
    "d": "Negotiate with the customer to provide additional funding for the new feature.",

    "answer": "b",

    "explanation": "The right process is to follow change control. In this case, the customer is asking for a change, so follow the change control process. It's quite possible that you can remove the old feature and add the new feature at the same cost, but it should be done following the change control process. Option a: ' Ask your manager for guidance: It is a responsibility of the P.M. to look for options to solve any problems related to the project before asking for guidance. Option (C) Remove some other feature and add the new feature. As a project manager, you can't add or remove the new feature without following the change control process.

    "question": "You're a project manager for a large project. Early on, you can identify a number of risks in the project and want to prepare them, and during the implementation phase, you have identified a potential risk. You have identified the response strategy for this risk, you have decided to purchase insurance to deal with this risk; however, buying insurance will cost you $500. This is an example of which risk response strategy?",

    "a": "Transference",
    "b": "Acceptance",
    "c": "Mitigation",
    "d": "Avoidance",

    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The idea behind a risk transfer is to transfer the risk and the consequences of that risk to a third party. The risk hasn't gone away, but the responsibility for the management of that risk now rests with another party. Most companies aren't willing to take on someone else's risk without a little cash thrown in for good measure. This strategy will impact the project budget ($ 500), and should be included in the cost estimate exercises, if you know you're going to use it. Transfer of risk can occur in many forms but is most effective when dealing with financial risks. Insurance is one form of risk transfer. You are probably familiar with how insurance works. Car insurance is a good example. You purchase car insurance so that if you come upon. Other forms of transference include warranties, guarantees, and performance bonds. Option B. Acceptance: This strategy indicates that the project team has decided not to change the project management plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify any other suitable response strategy.(strategy for both threats and Opportunities) Examples: active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the risks. Option C. Mitigation: is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the probability of occurrence or impact of a risk.  Examples: prototypes, and renting a generator into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the electricity. Option D. Avoid: It usually involves changing the project management plan to eliminate the threat entirely. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 443]"

If team members are not collaborative or open to differing ideas and perspectives, the environment can become counterproductive. Conflicts aren't bad in this case; they're necessary to get the team into the next stage. During this stage, it is best if you can limit your intervention and let team members resolve their own issues as often as possible. Option A. Norming, now things begin to calm down. Team members know each other fairly well by now. They're comfortable with their positions in the team, and they begin to deal with project problems instead of people problems. In the norming stage, they confront the project concerns and problems instead of each other. Decisions are made jointly at this stage, and team members exhibit mutual respect and familiarity with one another. As the project manager, you should continue to hold team meetings, especially during this stage. During this stage, you should intervene more often when conflicts arise to keep the team moving forward. Monitor each team member's participation, and encourage the team to continue to remain focused on the projects. Option B. Performing, this stage is where great teams end up and where team members are productive and effective. The level of trust among team members is high, and great things are achieved. This is the mature development stage. Your role as project manager during this stage should be more focused on the project management processes than on the team itself. Teams in this stage are usually self-directed and will hum along smoothly, provided you continue to update them on project progress and keep the lines of communication open. Option C. Forming, is the beginning stage of team formation, when all the members are brought together, introduced, and told the objectives of the project. This is where team members learn why they're working together. During this stage, team members tend to be formal and reserved and take on an “all-business” approach.

    "explanation": "answer D The best thing to do in such scenarios is to analyze the impact on the triple constraints. It's quite possible that the cost and/or the project schedule may increase. At the beginning of all projects, you should require two things regarding the change: • First, require that all change requests be submitted in writing. This is to clarify the change and make sure there's no confusion about what's requested. It also allows the project team to accurately estimate the time it will take to incorporate the change. • Second, require that all change requests must go through the formal change control system. Make sure no one is allowed to go directly to team members and request changes without the project manager knowing about them. Furthermore, make certain your stakeholders understand that going around the project manager can cause schedule delays, cost overruns, and sacrifices to quality and that it isn't good change management practice. From the beginning of the project, encourage the stakeholders to use the formal procedures laid out in the change control system to request changes."

    "c": "Cost plus fixed fee contracts",
    "d": "Fixed price contracts",

    "answer": "d",

    "explanation": "answer D. Fixed price contract. In this kind of contract, the biggest risk is borne by the seller. The seller—or contractor—must take great strides to assure they've covered their costs and will make a comfortable profit on the transaction. The seller assumes the risks of increasing costs, nonperformance, or other problems. However, to counter these unforeseen risks, the seller builds in the cost of the risk to the contract price. This is the most common type of contract and the most often used. Contract types help determine the risk the buyer and seller will bear during the life of the contract. The project manager should take this into consideration when purchasing goods and services outside the organization and make certain it is in keeping with the risk attitudes of the organization and stakeholders. There could always be 3 questionor 4 regarding contract types, so spend some time getting familiar with them. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 471]"

    "a": "Analogous estimating",
    "b": "Beta",
    "c": "Triangular",
    "d": "Bottom-up estimating",

    "answer": "a",

    "explanation": "answer A. Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques, but it is also less accurate. Option A and option (C): The accuracy of single-point duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk. Using three-point estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity's duration. Option (D): Bottom-up estimating is a good technique to use when you aren't confident about the type or quantity of resources you'll need for the project. This is an accurate means of estimating, provided the estimates at the schedule activity level are accurate. However, it takes a considerable amount of time to perform bottom-up estimating because every activity must be assessed and estimated accurately to be included in the bottom-up calculation. The smaller and more detailed the activity, the greater the accuracy and cost of this technique. For the Exam, Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower level components of the WBS.

    "b": "They are in the Performing stage of team development.",
    "c": "They are in the Forming stage of team development.",
    "d": "They are in the Storming stage of team development.",

    "answer": "b",

    "explanation": "answer B. Performing, Teams in the performing stage of team development, this stage is where great teams end up and where team members are productive and effective. The level of trust among team members is high, and great things are achieved. This is the mature development stage. Your role as project manager during this stage should be more focused on the project management processes than on the team itself. Teams in this stage are usually self-directed and will hum along smoothly, provided you continue to update them on project progress and keep the lines of communication open. Option A. Norming, now things begin to calm down. Team members know each other fairly well by now. They're comfortable with their positions in the team, and they begin to deal with project problems instead of people problems. In the norming stage, they confront the project concerns and problems instead of each other. Decisions are made jointly at this stage, and team members exhibit mutual respect and familiarity with one another. As the project manager, you should continue to hold team meetings, especially during this stage, because team members can fall back into the storming stage if left to their own devices. During this stage, you should intervene more often when conflicts arise to keep the team moving forward. Monitor each team member's participation, and encourage the team to continue to remain focused on the projects. Option C. Forming This one is easy. Forming is the beginning stage of team formation, when all the members are brought together, introduced, and told the objectives of the project. This is where team members learn why they're working together. During this stage, team members tend to be formal and reserved and take on an “all-business” approach. Option D. Storming is where the action begins. Team members become confrontational with each other as they're vying for position and control during this stage. They're working through who is going to be the top dog and jockeying for status. Your role as the project manager during this stage is to remind the team of the project goals and keep everyone centered on those goals. Conflicts aren't bad in this case; they're necessary to get the team into the next stage. During this stage, it is best if you can limit your intervention and let team members resolve their own issues as often as possible. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 338]"

Upper and lower specification limits are based on the requirements and reflect the maximum and minimum values allowed. For the exam, • The Rule of 7 is another way for the project Manager to use control charts and determine if the process is in control. The Rule of 7 works like this. If seven consecutive points or more fall on one side of the mean, this may indicate there are factors influencing the result, and they should be investigated. So, while the overall results are within the control limits, the process may not necessarily be in control, and those factors should be examined more closely. • A control chart is based on sample variance measurements. From the samples chosen and measured, the mean and standard deviation are determined. Control Quality is usually maintained—or said to be in control—within plus or minus three standard deviations. In other words, Control Quality says that if the process is in control (that is, the measurements fall within the control limits), you know that 99.73 percent of the parts going through the process will fall within an acceptable range of the mean. If you discover a part outside of this range, you should investigate and determine whether ive action is needed. • Option (A) A scatter diagram displays the relationship between two elements as points on the graph.

In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding up a closed fist (indicating no support) up to five fingers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer than three fingers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project manager continues the fist-of-five process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more fingers) or agrees to move on to the next decision. • 0 fingers (closed fist) – means the voter has serious objections and will block the proposal. • 1 finger – means the voter has strong reservations and wants to discuss issues and suggest changes that should be made. • 2 fingers – means the voter is moderately comfortable but has minor issues that may not need discussion. • 3 fingers – means the voter has a neutral standpoint because he likes some of it, but not all. • 4 fingers – means that the voter is supportive of the proposal. • All 5 fingers (show of the full palm) – means the voter is in complete agreement with the proposal and will also promote it.

    "explanation": "answer C. • Negotiations between the buyer and the potential seller are performed with the goal of reaching mutual agreement on the contractual terms and conditions. Where the exam is concerned, the goal of negotiations is to reach a win-win scenario between the buyer and seller. When the buyer exerts too much pressure on the seller or negotiates an untenable deal, this can backfire on both of them in the long run. Keep in mind that the project manager may or may not be the person who conducts these negotiations, as this can be a highly specialized area. On large and complex contracts, professional negotiators are the norm. • Arbitration involves bringing all parties to the table with a third, disinterested party who is not a participant in the contract to try to reach an agreement. The purpose of arbitration is to reach an agreement without having to go to court. Arbitration is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and could be a named tool in the contract for resolving disputes. Reaching a negotiated settlement through the aid of ADR techniques is the most favorable way to resolve the dispute. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 498]"

A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a building before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increased risk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical path. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities concerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs. Option (B): Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources. Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery to activities on the critical path.

One person forces a solution on the other parties. This is where the boss puts on the “Because I'm the boss and I said so” hat. Although this is a permanent solution, it isn't necessarily the best solution. People will go along with it because, well, they're forced to go along with it. It does not mean they agree with the solution. This isn't the best technique to use when you're trying to build a team. This is an example of a win-lose conflict resolution technique. The forcing party wins, and the losers are those who are forced to go along with the decision. • Option (A): Withdraw/Avoid When parties withdraw or avoid, they never reach resolution. The withdraw or avoid technique occurs when one of the parties gets up and leaves and refuses to discuss the conflict. It is probably the worst of all the techniques because nothing gets resolved. This is an example of a lose-lose conflict resolution technique. • Option (B). Collaborate/Problem Solve: The collaborate technique is also called problem solve and is the best way to resolve conflict. One of the key actions you'll perform with this technique is a fact-finding mission. • The thinking here is that one right solution to a problem exists and the facts will bear out the solution. Once the facts are uncovered, they're presented to the parties and the decision will be clear. Thus, the solution becomes a permanent one and the conflict expires. This is a win-win solution. Multiple viewpoints are discussed and shared using this technique, and team members have the opportunity to examine all the perspectives of the issue.Collaborating will lead to true consensus where team members commit to the decision. This is the conflict resolution approach project managers use most often and is an example of a win-win conflict resolution technique. Option ( C ): Compromise/Reconcile Parties that compromise or reconcile each give up something to reach a solution. Everyone involved decides what they will give on and what they won't give on, and eventually through all the give and take, a solution is reached. Neither side wins or loses in this situation. As a result, neither side is gung-ho about the decision that was reached. They will drag their feet and reluctantly trudge along. If, however, both parties make firm commitments to the resolution, then the solution becomes a permanent one. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 349]"

    "explanation": "answer D. The stakeholder register contains information about the stakeholder, including their contact information. Remember that you can use the stakeholder register template (part of the OPA inputs to this process) if your organization has one. The stakeholder register should contain at least the following details, according to the PMBOK® Guide, 6th. Edition.  Identifying Information. This includes items such as contact information, department, role in the project, and so on.  Assessment Information. This includes elements regarding influence, expectations, key requirements, and when the stakeholder involvement is most critical. It should also identify the phase of the project in which the stakeholder will have the most influence or impact.  Stakeholder Classification. This includes the classification elements we discussed in the “Tools and Techniques” section, including the influence, power, impact, direction of influence, and whether they are internal stakeholders or hold a position outside the organization. It's important to update the stakeholder register on a routine basis so that new stakeholders are added and those who have finished their role on the project are noted as completed.

    "c": "Charter closure meeting",
    "d": "Project kick-off meeting",

    "answer": "d",

    "explanation": "answer D. The PMBOK ® Guide-6th Edition, notes that kickoff meetings may occur in two different places in the project, depending on its size. • A small project generally involves a small project team who are actively involved in the Planning processes, so it makes sense to hold the kickoff meeting now (in planning process). • For large projects, a kickoff meeting is typically held in the Executing process group because the project manager and a few key team members will perform most of the planning before assigning other resources. • If the project is not mentioned is a large or small project, you must select the planning process as the best answer according to the PMI- PMP Exam content outline –planning domain –task # 12. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 86] The kick-off meeting, which is done in the beginning of the project and again before starting each new project phase, has four main objectives. Publicly state the beginning of the project Outline the project goals as well as the individual roles and responsibilities of team members Clarify the expectations of all parties Create commitment in all those who influence the project's outcome. The Project Manager conduct kick-off meeting, communicating the start of the project, key milestones, and other relevant information in order to inform and engage stakeholders and gain commitment. [PMI PMP Examination Content Outline – June 2015- PERFORMANCE DOMAIN II: PLANNING-Task # 12] For The exam, you must know the followings about the kick-off meeting: A kick off meeting is an important communication tool for you to communicate with your project stakeholders. If managed properly, this meeting can help you execute the project with minimal obstruction and you will be able to complete your project successfully. In the PMP exam question based on kick off meetings have appeared several times, though in the PMBOK Guide 5th edition, this term was not mentioned even a single time. It is commonly understood that although the term kick off meeting is absent from the PMBOK Guide, its intent is covered under the develop project team process whose objective is to improve feelings of trust, and to promote mutual understanding and agreement among team Members. Anyway, let's discuss it in detail. What is a Kick off Meeting? A kick off meeting is the first meeting among the project stakeholders. This meeting can be held among the high level project stakeholders such as the project sponsor, management, and the project manager. At the project level, you can have this meeting with your team members. Since all of your team members are new, this will be their first meeting together. If the project is small, you can have only one project meeting with all of your team members before starting the project work. However, if the project is large you can have it at the beginning of each phase. If the project is very large, complex and spread out in a large geographical area and you want to have a kick off meeting, you can have it. However in this case the meeting will be a virtual kick off meeting where all participants can communicate with each other through the internet. What is the Purpose of a Kick off Meeting? A kick off meeting is the first meeting with the project stakeholders, so you can simply say that it is a get to know kind of meeting. It is true that one objective of the kick off meeting is to get to know each other, since all of the project team members are new and don't know each other, it is important to have a familiarization session. Here you will introduce the sponsor of the project, top management, key customers and other important stakeholders. The other objective of a kick off meeting is to make all members aware of the project objectives, assumptions, constraints, deliverables, challenges, methodologies, procedures, plans, working environment, etc. The project team members may ask question if they need clarification. A successful kick off meeting ensures that all project stakeholders are on the same page and understand the project objectives well. This will help them complete the project more efficiently. How to Conduct a Kick off meeting the following are a few steps for conducting a successful kickoff meeting. Set the agenda this is the most important step. You should clearly decide what items you are going to discuss in the meeting. For example, you can include the introduction session, introduction to the project and its objectives, milestones, assumptions, constraints, and finally the questionand answer session. You should send this agenda to all attendees in advance so they can prepare themselves for the meeting. You should also distribute it just before the meeting starts. Conduct the Meeting As a project manager, you will have to conduct and lead the meeting (the key person). You will introduce yourself and ask others to follow suit. Afterwards, you will discuss the agenda and tell attendees what you are going to discuss in the meeting. You will explain the project charter and its content, such as project objectives, high level project assumptions and constraints. Tell them since this is the initial stage you will need their help to develop the detailed project management plan. Set the expectations clearly. For example, explain to them how many days they will have to work, about the rotation, and how leave will be granted. Explain the communication and reporting system. For instance, in what format you need the reports and how often meetings or communication should happen. Closure of the Meeting At the end of the meeting, you will hold a questionand answer session. Here participants can ask any questionthey may have about the project. You will thank all participants and ask them to contact you to clarify any doubts or for further question. Once the meeting is ended, you will prepare the minutes of the meeting and send it to all attendees for their review. You will also try to communicate with any important stakeholder who did not come to the meeting. You will send them the minutes of meeting and try to have a one-on-one meeting if necessary. Benefits of a Kick Off meeting. The following are a few benefits of a kick off meeting: • Communicating the start of the project. • The project manager gain the commitment from the key stakeholders. • It helps team members to get to know each other. • It demonstrates the project manager's authority and leadership skills. • It helps team members understand the project objectives. • It helps team members understand the project's milestones, risks, assumptions, and constraints. • It helps the project manager gain support from all stakeholders. • It gives the opportunity to all attendees to ask question and get clarity. • It brings all stakeholders to the same platform."

It wouldn't help you to add resources to noncritical path tasks; these tasks don't impact the schedule end date anyway because they have float time. Crashing could be accomplished by requiring mandatory overtime for critical path tasks or requiring overnight deliveries of materials rather than relying on standard shipping times. You may find that crashing the schedule can lead to increased risk or increased costs or both. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 215]"

    "answer": "c",

    "explanation": "answer C. The best way to describe this scenario is with an example. If you are the PM for a housing painting project. In order to paint, you first need to scrape the peeling paint and then prime. However, you can't begin painting until the primer has dried (2 or 3 days lag), so you shouldn't schedule priming for Monday and painting for Tuesday if you need the primer to dry on Tuesday. Therefore, the priming activity generates the need for lag time at the end of the activity to account for the drying time needed before you can start Painting. In this scenario (Imagine Task 1 is Painting, and Task 2 is Primer). Task 1 (Painting) can only be started 3 days (lag) after Task 2 started (until the primer has dried), then the relationship between task 1 and task 2: Start-to-Start relationship between the tasks with a 3-days lag on Task 1."
