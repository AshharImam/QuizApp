    "b": "  Planning",
    "c": "  Executing",
    "d": "  Closing",
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": " The PMBOK ® Guide-the Six Edition, notes that kickoff meetings may occur in two different places in the project, depending on its size. • A small project generally involves a small project team who are actively involved in the Planning processes, so it makes sense to hold the kickoff meeting now (in planning process). • For large projects, a kickoff meeting is typically held in the Executing process group because the project manager and a few key team members will perform most of the planning before assigning other resources. • If the project is not mentioned is a large or small project, you must select the planning process as the best answer according to the PMI- PMP Exam content outline –planning domain –task # 12.

    "question": " In your project, you implemented a risk response and hired an additional skilled technical worker that can help in testing your application. However, you are worried that the technical worker may leave - this new risk can also be called a: ",
    "a": " Secondary risk",
    "b": "Acceptance risk",
    "c": " Change Plan",
    "d": " Fallback Plan",
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": " Secondary risks are risks that come about as a result of implementing a risk response. The example given previously where you transferred risk by hiring a driver to take you to your destination but the person became ill along the way is an example of a secondary risk. The driver’s illness delayed your arrival time, which is a risk directly caused by hiring the driver or implementing a risk response. When planning for risk, identify and plan responses for secondary risks. • Fallback plans should be developed for risks with high impact or for risks with identified strategies that might not be the most effective at dealing with the risk. Fallback plans are not contingency plans. For example, in the information technology field, we often have high impact risks associated with upgrading operating systems or implementing new applications. A contingency plan may include calling the vendor to assist in the middle of the night (that’s always when things fall apart) when we can’t figure out a solution. A fallback plan in this case may describe how we are going to bring the old system back online so that users can still do their work while we figure out what went wrong with the implementation.

    "b": "WBS",
    "c": " Project charter",
    "d": " Business plans",
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Organizational process assets and historical information should be reviewed and examined when a new project is starting. Historical information can be useful to project managers and to stakeholders. • When you’re evaluating new projects, historical information about previous projects of a similar nature can be handy in determining whether the new project should be accepted and initiated. Historical information gathered and documented during an active project is used to assist in determining whether the project should proceed to the next phase. Historical information will help you with the project charter, project scope statement, and development of the project management plan, the process of defining and estimating activities, and more during the project-planning processes. • Understanding previous projects of a similar nature—their problems, successes, issues, and outcomes—will help you avoid repeating mistakes while reusing successful techniques to accomplish the goals of this project to the satisfaction of the stakeholders. Many of the processes in the project management process groups have organizational process assets as an input, implying that you should review the pertinent organizational assets that apply for the process you’re about to start. For example, when performing the Estimate Costs process, you might find it helpful to review the activity estimates and budgets on past projects of similar size and scope before estimating the costs for the activities on the new project.

The best way to think about top-down techniques is to look at the estimate as a whole. Think about being on a mountaintop where you can see the whole picture as one rather than all the individual items that make up the picture. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 200]"

    "d": " Project plan",
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": " Project scope statement. • The scope statement answers the query of what, why, who, where, and how. In combination with the work breakdown structure, it provides a detailed description of what must be accomplished. • The purpose of the project scope statement is to document the project objectives, deliverables, and the work required to produce the deliverables so that it can be used to direct the project team’s work and as a basis for future project decisions. The scope statement is an agreement between the project management team and the project customer that states precisely what the work of the project will produce. Simply put, the scope statement tells everyone concerned with the project exactly what they’re going to get when the work is finished. • Since the scope statement serves as a baseline for the project, if querys arise or changes are proposed later in the project, they can be compared to what’s documented in the scope statement. Making change decisions is easier when the original deliverables and requirements are well documented. You’ll also know what is out of scope for the project simply because the work isn’t documented in the scope statement (or conversely, deliverables or other elements are documented and noted as being specifically out of scope). The criteria outlined in the scope statement will also be used to determine whether the project was completed successfully. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 154]"

In some cases, conflict requires the involvement of the project sponsor or executive, especially when there is an impasse regarding resource assignments. Customers and contractors would not, in most cases, become involved in internal resource management disputes. The project sponsor, generally an executive in the organization with the authority to assign resources and enforce decisions regarding the project, is a stakeholder. The project sponsor generally serves as the tie-breaking decision maker and is one of the people on your escalation path.

One of the key actions you’ll perform with this technique is a fact-finding mission. The thinking here is that one right solution to a problem exists and the facts will bear out the solution. Once the facts are uncovered, they’re presented to the parties and the decision will be clear. Thus, the solution becomes a permanent one and the conflict expires. This is a win-win solution. Multiple viewpoints are discussed and shared using this technique, and team members have the opportunity to examine all the perspectives of the issue. Collaborating will lead to true consensus where team members commit to the decision. This is the conflict resolution approach project managers use most often and is an example of a win-win conflict resolution. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 349]"

    "b": "Scatter Diagram",
    "c": "  Inspection",
    "d": " Pareto chart",
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": " Control charts measure the results of processes over time and display the results in graph form. Control charts are a way to measure variances to determine whether process variances are in control or out of control. A control chart is based on sample variance measurements. From the samples chosen and measured, the mean and standard deviation are determined. Control Quality is usually maintained—or said to be in control—within plus or minus three standard deviations. In other words, Control Quality says that if the process is in control (that is, the measurements fall within the control limits), you know that 99.73 percent of the parts going through the process will fall within an acceptable range of the mean. If you discover a part outside of this range, you should investigate and determine whether ive action is needed. • The Rule of 7 is another way for the project team to use control charts and determine if the process is in control. The Rule of 7 works like this. If seven consecutive points or more fall on one side of the mean, this may indicate there are factors influencing the result, and they should be investigated. So, while the overall results are within the control limits, the process may not necessarily be in control, and those factors should be examined more closely. • When a process is in control, it should not be adjusted. When a process falls outside the acceptable limits, it should be adjusted. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 304]"

It wouldn’t help you to add resources to noncritical path tasks; these tasks don’t impact the schedule end date anyway because they have float time. Crashing could be accomplished by requiring mandatory overtime for critical path tasks or requiring overnight deliveries of materials rather than relying on standard shipping times. You may find that crashing. Also consider that crashing doesn’t always come up with a reasonable result. It often increases the costs of the project as well. The idea with crashing is to try to gain the greatest amount of schedule compression with the least amount of cost. [(PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition, Page 215]"

You can see by the arrangement of horizontal bars (each representing a sensitivity variable) how the diagram gets its name. The idea is that each sensitivity bar displays the low and high value possible for the element the bar represents. The querys you might encounter on the exam (at least 3 querys) are focused on the context of this type of analysis. The variables with the greatest effect on the project appear at the top of the graph and decrease in impact as you progress down through the graph. This gives you a quick overview of how much the project can be affected by uncertainty in the various elements. It also allows you to see at a glance which risks might have the biggest impacts on the project and will require carefully crafted, detailed response plans.

They look at a particular resource or groups of resources and their skills, abilities, quantity, and availability. Perhaps your project calls for a marketing resource and the person assigned to the marketing activities is on an extended vacation in June. The resource calendar would show this person’s vacation schedule. Resource calendars also examine the quantity, capability, and availability of equipment and material resources that have a potential to impact the project schedule. For example, suppose your project calls for a hydraulic drill and your organization owns only one. The resource calendar will tell you whether it’s scheduled for another job at the same time it’s needed for your project. For the final exam, Resource calendars show the team members’ availability and the times they are scheduled to work on the project. A composite resource calendar includes availability information for potential resources as well as their capabilities and skills. The Resource breakdown structure (RBS) lists the resources by category and type. You may have several categories of resources, including labor, hardware, equipment, supplies, and so on. Type describes the types of resources needed, such as skill levels or quality grades of the material and so on.

    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The best thing to do in such scenarios is to analyze the impact on the triple constraints. It's quite possible that the cost and/or the project schedule may increase. At the beginning of all projects, you should require two things regarding change. First, require that all change requests be submitted in writing. This is to clarify the change and make sure there's no confusion about what's requested. It also allows the project team to accurately estimate the time it will take to incorporate the change. Second, require that all change requests must go through the formal change control system. Make sure no one is allowed to go directly to team members and request changes without the project manager knowing about them. Furthermore, make certain your stakeholders understand that going around the project manager can cause schedule delays, cost overruns, and sacrifices to quality and that it isn't good change management practice. From the beginning of the project, encourage the stakeholders to use the formal procedures laid out in the change control system to request changes. For The Exam, you must know that: (Exam Essentials) Changes can come from: • The project manager • The sponsor • The customer • Project team, management or other stakeholders. Procedures to solve change requests querys on the exam. 1. Analyze (Evaluate) the impact of the change on the project constrains (scope, cost, time and quality). 2. Create a change request. 3.

These risks are evaluated and placed in the risk register. The PMBOK recommends conducting risk reassessments during team meetings as a part of the Monitor Risks process. Reassessment of risks should be a regular activity performed by everyone involved on the project. [PMBOK 6th edition, Page 457] [Project Risk Management]. Meetings that can be used during this process include but are not limited to risk reviews. Risk reviews are scheduled regularly and should examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with overall project risk and with identified individual project risks. Risk reviews may also result in identification of new individual project risks, (including secondary risks that arise from agreed-upon risk responses), reassessment of current risks, the closing of risks that are outdated, issues that have arisen as the result of risks that have occurred, and identification of lessons to be learned for implementation in ongoing phases in the current project or in similar projects in the future.

    "question": " You have identified a risk that will negatively affect your project. You and your team have decided to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat if it occurs. What type of risk strategy are you using?",
    "a": " Mitigation",
    "b": "Acceptance",
    "c": " Avoidance",
    "d": " Transfer",
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": " Acceptance is often a perfectly reasonable strategy for dealing with risk, whether positive or negative. When accepting a risk you are simply acknowledging that the best strategy may not be to avoid, transfer, mitigate, share, or enhance it. Instead, the best strategy may be simply to accept it and continue with the project. Many people miss querys on the exam related to this because they don’t have the mindset that acceptance may be the best strategy if the cost or impact of the other strategies is too great. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. Option A. Mitigation. According to the PMBOK® Guide 6th edition the purpose of mitigation is to reduce the probability that a risk will occur and/or reduce the impact of the risk to a level where you can accept the risk and its outcomes. It’s easier to take actions early on that will reduce the probability of a risk event or its consequences than it is to fix the damage once it has occurred. Some examples of risk mitigation include performing more tests, using less complicated processes, creating prototypes, and choosing more reliable vendors. Option C. Avoidance. To avoid a risk means you’ll evade it altogether by eliminating the cause of the risk event or by changing the project management plan to protect the project objectives from the risk event. Let’s say you’re going to take a car trip from your home to a point 1000 miles away. You know—because your brother who just took the same trip told you—that there is a long stretch of construction on one of the highways you’re planning on using. To avoid the risk of delay, you plan the trip around the construction work and use another highway for that stretch of driving. In this way, you change your plans, avoid the risk of getting held up in construction traffic, and arrive at your destination on time. With risk avoidance, you essentially eradicate the risk by eliminating its cause. Here’s another example: Suppose your project was kicked off without adequate scope definition and requirements gathering. You run a high probability of experiencing scope creep— ever-changing requirements—as the project progresses, thereby impacting the project schedule. You can avoid this risk by adequately documenting the project scope and requirements during the Planning processes and taking steps to monitor and control changes to scope so it doesn’t get out of hand. Risks that occur early in the project might easily be avoided by improving communications, refining requirements, assigning additional resources to project activities, refining the project scope to avoid risk events, and so on. This technique is generally used for risks with high impact and high probability of occurring. Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, extending the schedule, changing the project strategy, or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise. Option D. Transfer of risk can occur in many forms but is most effective when dealing with financial risks. Insurance is one form of risk transfer. You are probably familiar with how insurance works. Car insurance is a good example. You purchase car insurance so that if you come upon an obstacle in the road and there is no way to avoid hitting it, the cost to repair the damage to the car is paid by the insurance company…okay, minus the deductible and all the calculations for the age of the car. Buying insurance may include cost to the insurance company. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for specified risks to another party (Using a fixed price contract to transfer the most risk to the seller).

You can use the lowest level of the RBS to construct a prompt list for individual risks. According to the PMBOK® Guide 6th edition, you could consult strategic analysis tools to assist in determining overall project risk such as PESTLE, TECOP, or VUCA. • PESTLE analysis examines political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors to see if they may have an overall project impact. • TECOP analysis looks at technical, environmental, commercial, operational, and political risks. Like in the earlier example, you should examine each of these elements to determine if there are overall project risks that could impact the project. • VUCA analysis looks at volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. • Option A. Risk triggers. Triggers are warning signs or symptoms that a risk event is about to occur. For example, if you’re planning an outdoor gathering and rain clouds start rolling in from the north on the morning of the activity, you probably have a risk event waiting to happen.

Many times a project manager will use a responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) to graphically display this information. A RAM is usually depicted as a chart with resource names listed in each row (for example, programmers, testers, and trainers) and project phases or WBS elements listed as the columns. (It can also be constructed using team member names.) Indicators in the intersections show where the resources are needed. However, the level of detail is up to you. One RAM might be developed showing only project phases; another RAM might show level-two WBS elements for a complex project, with more RAMs subsequently produced for the additional WBS levels; or a RAM might be constructed with level-three elements only. .

A second reason is to determine the probability of the project succeeding. The study might also look at the technical issues related to the project and determine whether the technology proposed is feasible, reliable, and easily assimilated into the organization’s existing technology structure. Feasibility studies are typically conducted as the first phase of a project, but they might also be conducted as separate projects or subprojects. When you don’t have any preconceived ideas about the outcome of the study, it’s best to treat it as a separate project. The group of people conducting the feasibility study should not be the same people who will work on the project. The project manager and Project team members might have built-in biases toward the project and will tend to influence the feasibility outcome toward those biases. Before you take that plunge, you should know that some organizations will require a feasibility study prior to making a final decision about starting the project.

You want to improve the way that the team builds software, so you get them all to improve collaboratively and evolve experimentally by coming up with changes that they can make to their process together, and by using data to figure out if those changes made things better. Your project teams are focused on flowing work through the system to completion and not beginning new work until work in progress is completed. Which of the following methods are you using? ",

    "b": "Kanban Method",
    "c": " Scrumban",
    "d": " Critical Path Method ",
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": " The Kanban Method (Is very important for the exam) may be best used when a team or organization is in need of the following conditions: • Flexibility. Teams are typically not bound by timeboxes and will work on the highest priority item in the backlog of work. • Focus on continuous delivery. Teams are focused on flowing work through the system to completion and not beginning new work until work in progress is completed. • Increased productivity and quality. Productivity and quality are increased by limiting work in progress. • Increased efficiency. Checking each task for value adding or non-value-added activities and removing the non-value adding activities. • Team member focus. Limited work in progress allows the team to focus on the current work. • Variability in the workload. When there is unpredictability in the way that work arrives, and it becomes impossible for teams to make predictable commitments; even for short periods of time. • Reduction of waste. Transparency makes waste visible so it can be removed. Option ( A ) Crystal methodologies are designed to scale, and provide a selection of methodology rigor based on project size (number of people involved in the project) and the criticality of the project. Crystal Methodology realizes that each project may require a slightly tailored set of policies, practices, and processes in order to meet the project’s unique characteristics. The family of methodologies use different colors based on “weight” to determine which methodology to use. The use of the word crystal comes from the gemstone where the various “faces” represent underlying core principles and values. Option ( C ): Scrumban is an agile approach originally designed as a way to transition from Scrum to Kanban. As additional agile frameworks and methodologies emerged, it became an evolving hybrid framework in and of itself where teams use Scrum as a framework and Kanban for process improvement.

    "c": " Plan Risk Responses",
    "d": " Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis",
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": " Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis analyzes the probability of risks and their consequences using a numerical rating. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis might use numeric ratings but can use a high-medium-low scale as well. For the exam, understand the differences between the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis and Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis processes for the exam. The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process evaluates the impacts of risk prioritized during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. This process is not needed on every project, but when you do use it, it is typically performed for risks identified in Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis that could have a significant impact on the project. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis quantifies the aggregate risk exposure for the project by assigning numeric probabilities to risks and their impacts on project objectives. This quantitative approach is accomplished using techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation and decision tree analysis. Option D. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis determines the impact the identified risks will have on the project and the probability they’ll occur, and it puts the risks in priority order according to their effects on the project objectives. Option C. Plan Risk Responses is the process where risk response plans are developed using strategies such as escalate, avoid, transfer, mitigate, accept, exploit, share, enhance, develop contingent response strategies, and apply expert judgment. The risk response plan describes the actions to take should the identified risks occur. It should include all the identified risks, a description of the risks, how they’ll impact the project objectives, and the people assigned to manage the risk responses. Option A. The risk register is an output of the Identify Risks process, and updates to the risk register occur as an output of every risk process that follows this one. By the end of the Plan Risk Responses process, the risk register contains these primary elements: identified list of risks, risk owners, risk triggers, risk strategies, contingency plans, and contingency reserves.

    "b": "Expert judgment",
    "c": " Mind mapping",
    "d": " Monte Carlo simulation",
    "answer": "a",
    "explanation": " • The probability and impact matrix takes the probability and impact values one step further by assigning an overall risk score classification to each of the project’s identified risks. The combination of probability and impact results in a classification usually expressed as high, medium, or low. Typically, high risks are considered a red condition, medium risks are considered a yellow condition, and low risks are considered a green condition. This type of ranking is known as an ordinal scale because the values are ordered by rank from high to low. (In practice, ordinal values might also include ranking by position. In other words, the risks are listed in order by rank as the first, the second, the third, and so on.) • Remember that probability and impact can be determined for the risk as a whole, or for components of the project the risk may affect, such as the project schedule, cost, and quality. Option B. When evaluating risk, use experts who understand the tools associated with analyzing risk, including the benefits and drawbacks of the tools or methods you’ll use. For example, if your project involves manufacturing a new Car, you might want to consider experts such as engineers or statisticians. Option C. Mind mapping is used to visually organize information about stakeholders and their relationship to each other and the organization. Option D. Monte Carlo Simulation.
